PROJECT TAROT
=============

More reliable than existing methods.


If you manage to make a printed set, let me know how you got on.

Making money off those printed sets is a rotten trick though.

TODO:
=====

~~Re-generate card images at 300 dpi so printers won't point and laugh.~~

~~Tidy up some, none or all of the images so they're centred + B&W.~~

~~And the text.~~


HISTORY:
========

2015-11-18. v0.1 Release early, release often.

2015-11-30. v0.2 Font size + position fixes. Less worse pics. Looks splendid on MOO business cards.
